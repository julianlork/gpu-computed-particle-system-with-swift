# gpu-computed-particle-system-with-swift
Lookup project demonstrating how to compute and render basic particle systems.

## Introduction
Implementation of a simple particle system using Swift, SwiftUI and the Metal Shading Language. This repository is meant as a knowledge archive demonstrating on how to create basic particle systems, a gaussian blur render pass and conditional / positional coloring of particles.
